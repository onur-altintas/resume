abstract: Motivated by the increasing transition from fossil fuel–based
  centralized systems to renewable energy–based decentralized systems, we
  consider a bi-objective investment planning problem of a grid-connected
  decentralized hybrid renewable energy system. In this system, solar and wind
  are the main electricity generation resources.  A national grid is assumed to
  be a carbon-intense alternative to the renewables and is used as a backup
  source to ensure reliability. We consider both total cost and carbon emissions
  caused by electricity purchased from the grid. We first discuss a novel
  simulation-optimization algorithm and then adapt multi-objective metaheuristic
  algorithms. We integrate a simulation module to these algorithms to handle the
  stochastic nature of this bi-objective problem. We perform extensive
  comparative analysis for the solution approaches and report their performances
  in terms of solution time and quality based on well-known measures from the
  literature.
