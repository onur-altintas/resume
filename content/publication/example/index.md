abstract: >-
  Motivated by the increasing transition from fossil fuel–based centralized
  systems to renewable energy–based decentralized systems, we consider a
  bi-objective investment planning problem of a grid-connected decentralized
  hybrid renewable energy system. In this system, solar and wind are the main
  electricity generation resources.  A national grid is assumed to be a
  carbon-intense alternative to the renewables and is used as a backup source to
  ensure reliability. We consider both total cost and carbon emissions caused by
  electricity purchased from the grid. We first discuss a novel
  simulation-optimization algorithm and then adapt multi-objective metaheuristic
  algorithms. We integrate a simulation module to these algorithms to handle the
  stochastic nature of this bi-objective problem. We perform extensive
  comparative analysis for the solution approaches and report their performances
  in terms of solution time 

  and quality based on well-known measures from the literature.
