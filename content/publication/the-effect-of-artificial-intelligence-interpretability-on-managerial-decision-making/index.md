abstract: In recent years, the interpretability of sophisticated AI and ML
  models has gained importance. With interpretability, companies aim to increase
  their performance by promoting the adoption of better-performing AI systems.
  It has been shown that interpretability increases adoption, trust, and
  performance in predictable environments. However, users tend to resist
  following algorithmic advice in inherently uncertain domains such as
  recommending stocks, providing medical care, and managing a retail supply
  chain. In this work, we empirically investigate the effect of interpretability
  on adoption, trust, and performance in an uncertain business domain.
