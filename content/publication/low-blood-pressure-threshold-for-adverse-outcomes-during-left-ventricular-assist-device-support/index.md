abstract: It has been suggested that maintaining low mean arterial pressure
  (MAP) in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients is associated with a
  reduced risk of stroke/death. However, the lower limit of the optimal MAP
  range has not been established. In conclusion, our findings suggest that
  maintaining MAP â‰¤75 mm Hg during long-term follow-up in LVAD recipients is
  associated with increased risk of stroke/death regardless of risk factors or
  medical management.
